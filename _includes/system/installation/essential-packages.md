### Launch the pacstrap script

pacstrap is designed to create a new system installation from scratch. The specified packages will be installed into a given directory after setting up some basic mountpoints. By default, the host systemâ€™s pacman signing keys and mirrorlist will be used to seed the chroot.

##### Example
```
$ pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware {{ scenario.pkg_list }} vim man-db man-pages
```

---

## Generate the fstab file

genfstab helps fill in an fstab file by autodetecting all the current mounts below a given mountpoint and printing them in fstab-compatible format to standard output.

It can be used to persist a manually mounted filesystem hierarchy and is often used during the initial install and configuration of an OS.

```
$ genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

---

## Enter the system

```
$ arch-chroot /mnt
```
