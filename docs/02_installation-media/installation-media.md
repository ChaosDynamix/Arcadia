# Installation media
{: .mb-4}

This part cover the preparation of the installation media used to perform the Arch Linux installation.
{: .fs-5}

## [Preparation](/Andromeda/installation-media/preparation/)

The preparation of the installation media can be achieve with two supports

- USB flash device
- Compact disc

This support is flashed with the Arch Linux ISO image containing a full operating system that can be booted.

The result will be a installation media that can be used for installing Arch Linux, system maintenance or for recovery purposes, and that, because of the nature of SquashFS, will discard all changes once the computer shuts down.

## [Boot](/Andromeda/installation-media/booting/)

In order to boot the installation media you just created, we need to configure the firmware setup utility to change the boot order of the computer.
