## [USB flash device](/Andromeda/installation-media/preparation/usb-flash-device/)

A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated USB interface. It is typically removable, rewritable and much smaller than an optical disc.

Most current PC firmware permits booting from a USB drive, allowing the launch of an operating system from a bootable flash drive. Such a configuration is known as a Live USB. A live USB is a USB flash drive or external hard disk drive containing a full operating system that can be booted.
