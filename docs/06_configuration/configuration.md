# Configuration

---

## [Localization](/Andromeda/configuration/localization/)

Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

---

## [Network](/Andromeda/configuration/network/)

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as Ethernet or by wireless methods such as Wifi.

## [Users and groups](/Andromeda/configuration/users-and-groups/)

A user's account allows a user to authenticate to a system and potentially to receive authorization to access resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To log into an account, a user is typically required to authenticate oneself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, logging, and resource management.

In computing, the term group generally refers to a grouping of users. In principle, users may belong to none, one, or many groups (although in practice some systems place limits on this.) The primary purpose of user groups is to simplify access control to computer systems.

## [Initial ramdisk](/Andromeda/configuration/initial-ramdisk/)

In computing (specifically as regards Linux computing), initrd (initial ramdisk) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process.

`initrd` and `initramfs` refer to two different methods of achieving this. Both are commonly used to make preparations before the real root file system can be mounted.

## [Boot loader](/Andromeda/configuration/boot-loader/)

Second-stage boot loaders, such as GNU GRUB, rEFInd, BOOTMGR, Syslinux, NTLDR or BootX, are not themselves operating systems, but are able to load an operating system properly and transfer execution to it; the operating system subsequently initializes itself and may load extra device drivers. The second-stage boot loader does not need drivers for its own operation, but may instead use generic storage access methods provided by system firmware such as the BIOS or Open Firmware, though typically with restricted hardware functionality and lower performance.
