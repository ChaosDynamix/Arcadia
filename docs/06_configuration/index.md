# Configuration

## [Localization](/Andromeda/configuration/localization/)

Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

## [Network](/Andromeda/configuration/network/)

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as Ethernet or by wireless methods such as Wifi.

## [Users and groups](/Andromeda/configuration/users-and-groups/)

A user's account allows a user to authenticate to a system and potentially to receive authorization to access resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To log into an account, a user is typically required to authenticate oneself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, logging, and resource management.

In computing, the term group generally refers to a grouping of users. In principle, users may belong to none, one, or many groups (although in practice some systems place limits on this.) The primary purpose of user groups is to simplify access control to computer systems.
